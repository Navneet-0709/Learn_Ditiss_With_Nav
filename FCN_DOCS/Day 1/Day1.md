# Day 1
# Fundamentals OF Computer Networks 

# Networking
    - Wy do we need connectivity -- ... 
    - It is all about Data Communication , We can share Voice , Video Sharing , Device Sharing 
                                    Resource Sharing 

*  So basically every thing and main funnctionality of connectivity is Resource Sharing 
    - ISDN - Integrated Servecis Digial Network - have two channels 
           - one to transer voice and other to share videos  

- at first FDD were used with the pcs which was a little hard to use for copying everything so we needed to connect all the pcs 
- this Era Was called as decentralised Computation 
- And then we have client server technology
- then Cloud come to the picture (As a IAAS , SAAS , PAAS)

Network is basicsal divied into two main types
- LAN - If media belongs to u it is a LAN       - WAN - MEdia belngs to the third party ISP then its a WAN
    - Ethernet - Open source connctivity  have to study types of ethernet 
    - Token Ring - 
- MAC Addresss (Media Access Content)
- MAC address is distributed by IEEE
- CSMA / CD
